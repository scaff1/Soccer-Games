# Soccer-Games

During this project, I focus on the question "How does scoring the first goal change the probability of winning the match?". Also, â€œIs a team more likely to win more matches at home? This question was always around, and many soccer managers would rather play at home than away. But is the outcome of the match going to change depending on this condition? I will use statistical tools such as regression analysis and a variety of tests which will help to answer these questions that many people have been asking in the last decade.
